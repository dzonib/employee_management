@*If you are importing same model in multiple views, you can use this file to import in all of them*@

@using EmployeeManagement.ViewModels
@using EmployeeManagement.Models

@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

@*now you can use just model in details view, dont have to use full path*@
